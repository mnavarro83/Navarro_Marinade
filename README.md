# Navarro_Marinade
Ancient family secret handed down for generations and now open sourced.

Here it is friends, the "ancient family secret" is to freeze the meat while marinating. The longer you freeze it the better. This isn't required but it really makes the marinade pop and softens the meat. 3 days is the recommended minimum for freezing. Suggested cut of meat is "tri-tip roast" or as it is called in Mexican "picanya"; or in Spanish "punta trasera", but it works with any meat really. Even good on most non-beef. Mexicans WILL look at you funny if you call the cut of meat "punta trasera" as this is an insulting term to them.

The asumption is that one is grilling this. This marinade really does need a grill to shine.

Either way; ingredients:

- 1 1/2 cups of oil. I usually use canola but any vegetable oil will do.

- 1/2 cup Orange Juice

- 1/3 cup white vinegar

- 1/2 cup Worcestershire Sauce

- 1/3 cup soy sauce

- 2 - 4 tablespoons of salt (IE give it two and taste, add as necessary)

- Pepper to taste. Feel free to get fancy with your peppers if you want to give it some kick. I usually don't because there are always 2 or 3 in the crowd that intensely dislike heat. Plain black ground pepper is the base.

- Garlic, I usually use a 3 or 4 fresh cloves crushed

- Oregano, quite a bit

- Parsley, fresh preferably

- Coriander/Cilantro to taste. People who have the aversion to this spice normally report not minding it in this recepie however skipping this spice is not a big deal. The magic is in the next ingredient.

- 2 tablespoons dry mustard, at the very least. Do not skimp on the mustard, can't really have too much. If you taste it and it feels like it is missing something it will either be mustard or salt.

This is the base recepie and it never disappoints. There is no "method" just mix everything together. A large blender is useful. I have in the past, singly or together, added beer (IPA or stout), ginger (fresh) and Brucken Steak Seasoning (https://www.bruckenfoods.com/) with mild to middling results. These variations make the base recepie a bit different and interesting but I don't consider these changes a partof the base recepie.
